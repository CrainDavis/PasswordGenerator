# PasswordGenerator
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Description:
This is a random password generator that, by incorporating the user's choices of character type and password length, will generate randomized passwords such as the following: 
```
bT1(aA6@yS2<

wX2aY2zV

6,8[0%0{3%

vH6vL7qS9sK9lN5jL4rC6oO7q

kY1-kE9)fG0^cS9=fE5[fB3}oJ8?uK5-hB9=oE5]nP9$mH4[bE1-kL5#aI8)uH9$oA7$eG6?aV0,oZ2=cR1-lD6?fN2-kB8]rW4=
```
This program requires generated passwords to have a minimum length of 8 characters, and allows for a maximum of 128. This program also allows users to include (or exclude) the following character types:
* lower case letters `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`
* upper case letters `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`
* numbers `0123456789`
* special characters `!@#$%^&*()-_=+,./<>?[]{}~`
Users are allowed to choose just one type of character, choose a combination, or choose all four to include in their randomized passwords. The user will decide their password criteria by answering a series of prompts that pop up on the page.
